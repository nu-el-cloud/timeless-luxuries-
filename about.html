            <p><strong>Timeless Since 1982</strong> is more than just a clothing brand — it’s a story of heritage, resilience, and style that never fades.</p>

            <p>The name was inspired by a phrase my mother always told me: <em>“Your glory is timeless.”</em> Born in 1982, she became the symbol of strength, beauty, and inspiration in my life. From her, I learned that true style is not just about trends, but about leaving a mark that lasts forever.</p>

            <p>Every piece we create carries that spirit — classic, bold, and built to transcend seasons. <strong>Timeless Since 1982</strong> is for those who wear their confidence, embrace their story, and believe that their light will never dim.</p>

            <p>This isn’t just fashion. This is <strong>legacy</strong>.</p>
